# Overview

The idea is to model the dynamics of interaction between people. 
Key things to remember are: According to facebook as referenced in the notebook, most people are interconnected by a degree 3.
I thus simplified the models utilized by ensuring their connectivity is of degree 3. The wights of connection have been dynamized in the code as per the specifications stated in their description.

Custom heuristics and intervention heuristics were inbuilt into the code to test it. A variation in the color of the hubs indicates diversity. Uniformity indicates a common belief or a general state of peace and homogeneity. 

This model attempts to illustrate how people interact, it generates random conflics and visualizes how the network reacts.
